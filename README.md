Personal Website

# Rough Draft Template

First Draft Setup of Personal Website:

Pages (possibly set up in tabs):

Home - Picture of me behind fancy text with a quick paragraph. You can see an example of this at this URL: https://collegeinfogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/samkapila-650x364.jpg

About - I want reactful appearing pictures on the sides of text about me: https://www.creative-tim.com/blog/web-design/create-scrolling-transformations-react-app/
**NEW NOTE**
We need sticky sidebars for what I'm trying to go for: https://codepen.io/ncerminara/pen/VdLpzd?editors=1100

Similar in scope to: https://melaniedaveid.com/

Possible react library: https://react-sticky-box.codecks.io/examples/complex/

Video of someone making simple example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blFjpsV7pA4

Resume - Have my most up to date resume on a page and a way to download it straight from said page

Contact - Quick information to contact me

Blog - Think about possibly starting a blog. This will probably have code snippet functionality like other tech blogs

Additional Considerations:

Possibly have my social media on both the contact and home page
